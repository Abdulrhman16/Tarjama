create your first chatbot all you need

47
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,640
to do is click on create chatbot right

here and then click on edit as you can

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,000
see you can learn bot press start from

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,640
scratch or AI public personality we're

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
going to start from scratch use the

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,160
template and this is how it looks

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
straight off the bat all we need to do

54
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,280
is just delete this node and we're going

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
to keep this simple node in here if you

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
never build a chatbot this tutorial is

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,640
for you I'm going to go from complete

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,319
Basics I'm even going to delete this one

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,920
so you can start from scratch as you can

60
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,040
see we start with a start node and we

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,319
have an end node all we need to do to

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
begin is right click click standard node

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,879
and now we are beginning I'm going to

64
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,560
drag the start note in here and let's

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
write for example now I'm going to go

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,159
over to the left side where you can see

67
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,319
all of these cards this is everything

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
that we can do within a node to still

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,480
keep it basic I'm going to drag a text

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,599
card right into our node as you can see

71
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,040
this prompts us to send a message I'm

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
going to write hello welcome to your

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
personalized chat bot and now what we

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
could do is drag from the node over to

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,480
the end and we would have a complete

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,319
chat bot that doesn't do anything but we

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
actually wanted to do a lot of things so

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,400
in this example let's imagine that I run

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,120
an AI agency that helps companies from

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
one to 100 employees set up their own

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
custom chat Bots first we're going to

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,439
ask them how many employees they have

83
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,920
then we're going to ask them if they

84
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,360
need more personalized help that gathers

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,799
their email and sends them to an

86
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,280
appointment scheduler this example will

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,640
help you set up any chat bot that you

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,000
want as we go through the different

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,360
filters and cards to add so we're not

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
going to drag this one to the end we're

91
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,080
going to right click and add a standard

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,799
card I'll drag the El card over to the

93
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,439
standard new card and I'm going to name

94
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,200
it ask now I'm going to use any of these

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,159
capture information cards to get a

96
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,560
prompted response in this case we're

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,439
going to use the number because what

98
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,840
we're going to ask is how many employees

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
does your company have we're then going

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
to click on select and create variable

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,199
so we can store their answer later I'm

102
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,639
going to call it num click on enter and

103
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,360
I'll show you how we're going to use

104
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,400
that later I'm going to click on ADD

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
card and we're going to add two

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
different expression nodes that triggers

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,160
on different different answers I'll

108
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,639
click on the number again and here we

109
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,800
can now start writing our choices I'm

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
going to say between 1 and 10 I'll click

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
on the plus icon and write above 11 use

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
natural language here because it

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
actually understands as you can see on

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
the Node itself we actually got two

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
outputs here now so I'm going to delete

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,479
these cuz we don't need them for the

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,560
next step I'm going to add a standard

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
node and I'm going to add other standard

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
node and now I'll teach you about the

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,759
variables if I add a card here and click

121
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,199
on text again what we can do is say

122
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,039
something like hey cool that your

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,400
company has we'll click on this variable

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
that will write exactly what they just

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
said then we'll say something like what

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
we recommend is watching this YouTube

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,759
video and it could be a landing page it

128
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,520
could be anything that you made for that

129
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,960
specific audience So This Is The Answer

130
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
between 1 and 10 and then we can just

131
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,000
copy this entire card and just paste it

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
in the second card it will have the

133
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,639
exact same number except you will just

134
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,240
change out the link or information for

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
that target audience make sure to

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,120
connect the nodes and our chat bot is

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,199
starting to look nice The Next Step

138
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,199
We'll add a new standard node and for

139
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,720
this one we'll add a card that is a

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,600
multiple choice with that selected we'll

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,720
go over to the right and add choices

142
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,759
like yes and no with the question would

143
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,199
you like to talk with one of our AI

144
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,800
experts we just make sure to connect the

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,680
nodes both of them into the same field

146
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,720
and now based on their answer you can

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
see no here you can see yes here for yes

148
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,880
we'll add a standard node that we're

149
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,039
going to add this email address card so

150
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
we can get their email I'll say okay

151
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
cool what is your email so we can

152
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,360
contact you I'll also create a new

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,199
variable called email and we'll also add

154
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,000
a standard node for the no and we'll

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,360
send a message that's more ending

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
sending them to our YouTube channel or

157
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,479
maybe your blog and we'll connect these

158
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,680
notes but since we're only making a

159
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,199
simple chatbot I want to show you some

160
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,639
more advanced features if you go to the

161
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,680
top and click on flows you can see that

162
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,759
you can add a default knowledge base

163
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,639
this is good for you because you can

164
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,520
have answers in here that the AI will be

165
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,360
able to answer we can just click on

166
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,160
knowledge based source and here you can

167
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,680
upload documents with web pages web

168
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,520
search or text document we can add pages

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,840
and add from sitap this is by far the

170
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,039
most extensive way to get your entire

171
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,479
website database into your chatbot take

172
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,960
for example this random website that I

173
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,360
found all you need to do is to go to the

174
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,960
end of the URL and then write

175
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,840
sitemap.xml and here we see all of their

176
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
data and you probably have this on your

177
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,919
website as well copy this link and now

178
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,120
you can see that they got

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,440
4,900 URLs that you can add the data

180
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,319
from this is important to you if you

181
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
have an FAQ about your shipping times or

182
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,360
